31,"Om! Having bowed down into Narayana, and to Nara, the foremost of men, as"
32,"also to the goddess Sarasvati, should the word ""Jaya"" be uttered."
33,
34,"Janamejaya said, ""Having attained to Heaven, what regions were"
35,"respectively attained by my grandsires of old, viz., the Pandavas and the"
36,sons of Dhritarashtra? I desire to hear this. I think that thou art
37,"conversant with everything, having been taught by the great Rishi Vyasa"
38,of wonderful feats.
39,
40,"Vaishampayana said, ""Listen now to what thy grandsires, Yudhishthira and"
41,"others, did after having attained to Heaven, that place of the deities."
42,"Arrived at Heaven, king Yudhishthira the just, beheld Duryodhana endued"
43,with prosperity and seated on an excellent seat. He blazed with
44,effulgence like the sun and wore all those signs of glory which belong to
45,heroes. And he was in the company of many deities of blazing effulgence
46,"and of Sadhyas of righteous deeds. Yudhishthira, beholding Duryodhana and"
47,"his prosperity, became suddenly filled with rage and turned back from the"
48,sight.
49,
50,"""He loudly addressed his companions, saying, I do not desire to share"
51,regions of felicity with Duryodhana who was stained by cupidity and
52,"possessed of little foresight. It was for him that friends, and kinsmen,"
53,over the whole Earth were slaughtered by us whom he had afflicted greatly
54,"in the deep forest. It was for him that the virtuous princess of Pancala,"
55,"Draupadi of faultless features, our wife, was dragged into the midst of"
56,"the assembly before all our seniors. Ye gods, I have no desire to even"
57,behold Suyodhana. I wish to go there where my brothers are.
58,
59,"""Narada, smiling, told him, It should not be so, O king of kings. While"
60,"residing in Heaven, all enmities cease. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, do"
61,not say so about king Duryodhana. Hear my words. Here is king Duryodhana.
62,He is worshipped with the gods by those righteous men and those foremost
63,of kings who are now denizens of Heaven. By causing his body to be poured
64,"as a libation on the fire of battle, he has obtained the end that"
65,"consists in attainment of the region for heroes. You and your brothers,"
66,"who were veritable gods on Earth, were always persecuted by this one. Yet"
67,through his observance of Kshatriya practices he has attained to this
68,region. This lord of Earth was not terrified in a situation fraught with
69,terror.
70,
71,"""O son, thou shouldst not bear in mind the woes inflicted on thee on"
72,account of the match at dice. It behoveth thee not to remember the
73,afflictions of Draupadi. It behoveth thee not to remember the other woes
74,"which were yours in consequence of the acts of your kinsmen,the woes,"
75,"viz., that were due to battle or to other situations. Do thou meet"
76,Duryodhana now according to the ordinances of polite intercourse. This is
77,"Heaven, O lord of men. There can be no enmities here."
78,
79,"""Though thus addressed by Narada, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, endued with"
80,"great intelligence, enquired about his brothers and said, If these"
81,"eternal regions reserved for heroes be Duryodhanas, that unrighteous and"
82,"sinful wight, that man who was the destroyer of friends and of the whole"
83,"world, that man for whose sake the entire Earth was devastated with all"
84,"her horses and elephants and human beings, that wight for whose sake we"
85,"were burnt with wrath in thinking of how best we might remedy our wrongs,"
86,I desire to see what regions have been attained by those high-souled
87,"heroes, my brothers of high vows, steady achievers of promises, truthful"
88,"in speech, and distinguished for courage. The high-souled Karna, the son"
89,"of Kunti, incapable of being baffled in battle, Dhrishtadyumna, Satyaki,"
90,the sons of Dhrishtadyumna and those other Kshatriyas who met with death
91,"in the observance of Kshatriya practices, where are those lords of Earth,"
92,"O Brahmana? I do not see them here, O Narada. I desire to see, O Narada,"
93,"Virata and Drupada and the other great Kshatriyas headed by Dhrishtaketu,"
94,"as also Shikhandi, the Pancala prince, the sons of Draupadi, and"
95,"Abhimanyu, irresistible in battle."

100,
101,"""Yudhishthira said, Ye deities, I do not see here Radhas son of"
102,"immeasurable prowess, as also my high-souled brothers, and Yudhamanyu and"
103,"Uttamaujas, those great car-warriors that poured their bodies (as"
104,"libations) on the fire of battle, those kings and princes that met with"
105,death for my sake in battle. Where are those great car-warriors that
106,possessed the prowess of tigers? Have those foremost of men acquired this
107,"region? If those great car-warriors have obtained these regions, then"
108,"only do you know, ye gods, that I shall reside here with those"
109,high-souled ones. If this auspicious and eternal region has not been
110,"acquired by those kings, then know, ye gods, that without those brothers"
111,"and kinsmen of mine, I shall not live here. At the time of performing the"
112,"water rites (after the battle), I heard my mother say, Do thou offer"
113,"oblations of water unto Karna. Since hearing those words of my mother, I"
114,"am burning with grief. I grieve also incessantly at this, ye gods, that"
115,when I marked the resemblance between the feet of my mother and those of
116,"Karna of immeasurable soul, I did not immediately place myself under"
117,"orders of that afflicter of hostile ranks. Ourselves joined with Karna,"
118,Shakra himself would have been unable to vanquish in battle. Wherever may
119,"that child of Surya be, I desire to see him. Alas, his relationship with"
120,"us being unknown, I caused him to be slain by Arjuna. Bhima also of"
121,"terrible prowess and dearer to me than my life-breaths, Arjuna too,"
122,"resembling Indra himself, the twins also that resembled the Destroyer"
123,"himself in prowess, I desire to behold. I wish to see the princess of"
124,"Pancala, whose conduct was always righteous. I wish not to stay here. I"
125,"tell you the truth. Ye foremost ones among the deities, what is Heaven to"
126,me if I am dissociated from my brothers? That is Heaven where those
127,"brothers of mine are. This, in my opinion, is not Heaven."
128,
129,"""The gods said, If thou longest to be there, go then, O son, without"
130,"delay. At the command of the chief of the deities, we are ready to do"
131,what is agreeable to thee.
132,
133,"Vaishampayana continued: Having said so, the gods then ordered the"
134,"celestial messenger, O scorcher of foes, saying, Do thou show unto"
135,Yudhishthira his friends and kinsmen. Then the royal son of Kunti and the
136,"celestial messenger proceeded together, O foremost of kings, to that"
137,place where those chiefs of men (whom Yudhishthira had wished to see)
138,"were. The celestial messenger proceeded first, the king followed him"
139,behind. The path was inauspicious and difficult and trodden by men of
140,"sinful deeds. It was enveloped in thick darkness, and covered with hair"
141,"and moss forming its grassy vesture. Polluted with the stench of sinners,"
142,"and miry with flesh and blood, it abounded with gadflies and stinging"
143,bees and gnats and was endangered by the inroads of grisly bears. Rotting
144,"corpses lay here and there. Overspread with bones and hair, it was"
145,noisome with worms and insects. It was skirted all along with a blazing
146,"fire. It was infested by crows and other birds and vultures, all having"
147,"beaks of iron, as also by evil spirits with long mouths pointed like"
148,needles. And it abounded with inaccessible fastnesses like the Vindhya
149,"mountains. Human corpses were scattered over it, smeared with fat and"
150,"blood, with arms and thighs cut off, or with entrails torn out and legs"
151,severed.
152,
153,"""Along that path so disagreeable with the stench of corpses and awful"
154,"with other incidents, the righteous-souled king proceeded, filled with"
155,"diverse thoughts. He beheld a river full of boiling water and, therefore,"
156,"difficult to cross, as also a forest of trees whose leaves were sharp"
157,swords and razors. There were plains full of fine white sand exceedingly
158,"heated, and rocks and stones made of iron. There were many jars of iron"
159,"all around, with boiling oil in them. Many a Kuta-salmalika was there,"
160,"with sharp thorns and, therefore, exceedingly painful to the touch. The"
161,son of Kunti beheld also the tortures inflicted upon sinful men.
162,
163,"""Beholding that inauspicious region abounding with every sort of"
164,"foulness, Yudhishthira asked the celestial messenger, saying, How far"
165,shall we proceed along a path like this? It behoveth thee to tell me
166,where those brothers of mine are. I desire also to know what region is
167,this of the gods?
168,
169,
170,
171,"""Hearing these words of king Yudhishthira the just, the celestial"
172,"messenger stopped in his course and replied, saying, Thus far is your"
173,"way. The denizens of Heaven commanded me that having come thus far, I am"
174,"to stop. If thou art tired, O king of kings, thou mayst return with me."
175,
176,"""Yudhishthira, however, was exceedingly disconsolate and stupefied by the"
177,"foul odour. Resolved to return, O Bharata, he retraced his steps."
178,"Afflicted by sorrow and grief, the righteous-souled monarch turned back."
179,"Just at that moment he heard piteous lamentations all around, O son of"
180,"Dharma, O royal sage, O thou of sacred origin, O son of Pandu, do thou"
181,"stay a moment for favouring us. At thy approach, O invincible one, a"
182,"delightful breeze hath begun to blow, bearing the sweet scent of thy"
183,"person. Great hath been our relief at this. O foremost of kings,"
184,"beholding thee, O first of men, great hath been our happiness. O son of"
185,"Pritha, let that happiness last longer through thy stay here, for a few"
186,"moments more. Do thou remain here, O Bharata, for even a short while. As"
187,"long as thou art here, O thou of Kurus race, torments cease to afflict"
188,"us. These and many similar words, uttered in piteous voices by persons in"
189,"pain, the king heard in that region, wafted to his ears from every side."
190,
191,"""Hearing those words of beings in woe, Yudhishthira of compassionate"
192,"heart exclaimed aloud, Alas, how painful! And the king stood still. The"
193,speeches of those woe-begone and afflicted persons seemed to the son of
194,Pandu to be uttered in voices that he had heard before although he could
195,not recognise them on that occasion.
196,
197,"""Unable to recognise voices, Dharmas son, Yudhishthira, enquired, saying,"
198,Who are you? Why also do you stay here?
199,
200,"""Thus addressed, they answered him from all sides, saying, I am Karna! I"
201,am Bhimasena! I am Arjuna! I am Nakula! I am Sahadeva! I am
202,"Dhrishtadyumna! I am Draupadi! We are the sons of Draupadi! Even thus, O"
203,"king, did those voices speak."
204,
205,"""Hearing those exclamations, O king, uttered in voices of pain suitable"
206,"to that place, the royal Yudhishthira asked himself What perverse destiny"
207,is this? What are those sinful acts which were committed by those
208,"high-souled beings, Karna and the sons of Draupadi, and the"
209,"slender-waisted princess of Pancala, so that their residence has been"
210,assigned in this region of foetid smell and great woe? I am not aware of
211,any transgression that can be attributed to these persons of righteous
212,"deeds. What is that act by doing which Dhritarashtras son, king"
213,"Suyodhana, with all his sinful followers, has become invested with such"
214,"prosperity? Endued with prosperity like that of the great Indra himself,"
215,he is highly adored. What is that act through the consequence of which
216,these (high-souled ones) have fallen into Hell? All of them were
217,"conversant with every duty, were heroes, were devoted to truth and the"
218,Vedas; were observant of Kshatriya practices; were righteous in their
219,acts; were performers of sacrifices; and givers of large presents unto
220,"brahmanas. Am I asleep or awake? Am I conscious or unconscious? Or, is"
221,all this a mental delusion due to disorders of the brain?
222,
223,"""Overwhelmed by sorrow and grief, and with his senses agitated by"
224,"anxiety, king Yudhishthira indulged in such reflections for a long time."
225,"The royal son of Dharma then gave way to great wrath. Indeed,"
226,"Yudhishthira then censured the gods, as also Dharma himself. Afflicted by"
227,"the very foul odour, he addressed the celestial messenger, saying, Return"
228,to the presence of those whose messenger thou art. Tell them that I shall
229,"not go back to where they are, but shall stay even here, since, in"
230,"consequence of my companionship, these afflicted brothers of mine have"
231,"become comforted. Thus addressed by the intelligent son of Pandu, the"
232,celestial messenger returned to the place where the chief of the deities
233,"was, viz., he of a hundred sacrifices. He represented unto him the acts"
234,"of Yudhishthira. Indeed, O ruler of men, he informed Indra of all that"
235,Dharmas son had said!
236,
237,
238,
239,3
240,
241,"Vaishampayana said, ""King Yudhishthira the just, the son of Pritha, had"
242,"not stayed there for more than a moment when, O thou of Kurus race, all"
243,the gods with Indra at their head came to that spot. The deity of
244,Righteousness in his embodied form also came to that place where the Kuru
245,"king was, for seeing that monarch. Upon the advent of those deities of"
246,"resplendent bodies and sanctified and noble deeds, the darkness that had"
247,overwhelmed that region immediately disappeared. The torments undergone
248,"by beings of sinful deeds were no longer seen. The river Vaitarani, the"
249,"thorny Salmali, the iron jars, and the boulders of rock, so terrible to"
250,"behold, also vanished from sight. The diverse repulsive corpses also,"
251,"which the Kuru king had seen, disappeared at the same time. Then a"
252,"breeze, delicious and fraught with pleasant perfumes, perfectly pure and"
253,"delightfully cool, O Bharata, began to blow on that spot in consequence"
254,"of the presence of the gods. The Maruts, with Indra, the Vasus with the"
255,"twin Ashvinis, the Sadhyas, the Rudras, the Adityas, and the other"
256,"denizens of Heaven, as also the Siddhas and the great Rishis, all came"
257,there where Dharmas royal son of great energy was.
258,
259,"""Then Shakra, the lord of the deities, endued with blazing prosperity,"
260,"addressed Yudhishthira and comforting him, said, O Yudhishthira of mighty"
261,"arms, come, come, O chief of men. These illusions have ended, O puissant"
262,"one. Success has been attained by thee, O mighty-armed one, and eternal"
263,regions (of felicity) have become thine. Thou shouldst not yield to
264,"wrath. Listen to these words of mine. Hell, O son, should without doubt"
265,"be beheld by every king. Of both good and bad there is abundance, O chief"
266,of men. He who enjoys first the fruits of his good acts must afterwards
267,"endure Hell. He, on the other hand, who first endures Hell, must"
268,afterwards enjoy Heaven. He whose sinful acts are many enjoys Heaven
269,"first. It is for this, O king, that desirous of doing thee good, I caused"
270,"thee to be sent for having a view of Hell. Thou hadst, by a pretence,"
271,"deceived Drona in the matter of his son. Thou hast, in consequence"
272,"thereof, been shown Hell by an act of deception. After the manner of"
273,"thyself, Bhima and Arjuna, and Draupadi, have all been shown the place of"
274,"sinners by an act of deception. Come, O chief of men, all of them have"
275,been cleansed of their sins. All those kings who had aided thee and who
276,"have been slain in battle, have all attained to Heaven. Come and behold"
277,"them, O foremost one of Bharatas race."
278,
279,"""Karna, the mighty bowman, that foremost of all wielders of weapons for"
280,"whom thou art grieving, has also attained to high success. Behold, O"
281,"puissant one, that foremost of men, viz., the son of Surya. He is in that"
282,"place which is his own, O mighty-armed one. Kill this grief of thine, O"
283,"chief of men. Behold thy brothers and others, those kings, that is, who"
284,had espoused thy side. They have all attained to their respective places
285,(of felicity). Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled. Having endured a
286,"little misery first, from this time, O son of Kurus race, do thou sport"
287,"with me in happiness, divested of grief and all thy ailments dispelled. O"
288,"mighty-armed one, do thou now enjoy, O king, the rewards of all thy deeds"
289,of righteousness of those regions which thou hast acquired thyself by thy
290,"penances and of all thy gifts. Let deities and Gandharvas, and celestial"
291,"Apsaras, decked in pure robes and excellent ornaments, wait upon and"
292,"serve thee for thy happiness. Do thou, O mighty-armed one, enjoy now"
293,those regions (of felicity) which have become thine through the Rajasuya
294,sacrifice performed by thee and whose felicities have been enhanced by
295,the sacrificial scimitar employed by thee. Let the high fruits of thy
296,"penances be enjoyed by thee. Thy regions, O Yudhishthira, are above,"
297,"those of kings. They are equal to those of Hariscandra, O son of Pritha."
298,"Come, and sport there in bliss. There where the royal sage Mandhatri is,"
299,"there where king Bhagiratha is, there where Dushmantas son Bharata is,"
300,"there wilt thou sport in bliss. Here is the celestial river, sacred and"
301,sanctifying the three worlds. It is called Heavenly Ganga. Plunging into
302,"it, thou wilt go to thy own regions. Having bathed in this stream, thou"
303,"wilt be divested of thy human nature. Indeed, thy grief dispelled, thy"
304,"ailments conquered, thou wilt be freed from all enmities."
305,
306,"""While, O Kuru king, the chief of the gods was saying so unto"
307,"Yudhishthira, the deity of Righteousness, in his embodied form, then"
308,"addressed his own son and said, O king, I am greatly pleased, O thou of"
309,"great wisdom, with thee, O son, by thy devotion to me, by thy"
310,"truthfulness of speech, and forgiveness, and self-restraint. This,"
311,"indeed, is the third test, O king, to which I put thee. Thou art"
312,"incapable, O son of Pritha, of being swerved from thy nature or reason."
313,"Before this, I had examined thee in the Dwaita woods by my questions,"
314,when thou hadst come to that lake for recovering a couple of fire sticks.
315,"Thou stoodst it well. Assuming the shape of a dog, I examined thee once"
316,"more, O son, when thy brothers with Draupadi had fallen down. This has"
317,been thy third test; thou hast expressed thy wish to stay at Hell for the
318,"sake of thy brothers. Thou hast become cleansed, O highly blessed one."
319,"Purified of sin, be thou happy."
320,
321,"O son of Pritha, thy brothers, O king, were not such as to deserve Hell."
322,All this has been an illusion created by the chief of the gods. Without
323,"doubt, all kings, O son, must once behold Hell. Hence hast thou for a"
324,"little while been subjected to this great affliction. O king, neither"
325,"Arjuna, nor Bhima, nor any of those foremost of men, viz., the twins, nor"
326,"Karna, ever truthful in speech and possessed of great courage, could be"
327,"deserving of Hell for a long time. The princess Krishna too, O"
328,"Yudhishthira, could not be deserving of that place of sinners. Come,"
329,"come, O foremost one of the Bharatas, behold Ganga who spreads her"
330,current over the three worlds.
331,
332,"""Thus addressed, that royal sage, viz., thy grandsire, proceeded with"
333,Dharma and all the other gods. Having bathed in the celestial river
334,"Ganga, sacred and sanctifying and ever adored by the Rishis, he cast off"
335,"his human body. Assuming then a celestial form, king Yudhishthira the"
336,"just, in consequence of that bath, became divested of all his enmities"
337,"and grief. Surrounded by the deities, the Kuru king Yudhishthira then"
338,"proceeded from that spot. He was accompanied by Dharma, and the great"
339,"Rishis uttered his praises. Indeed, he reached that place where those"
340,"foremost of men, those heroes, viz., the Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras,"
341,"freed from (human) wrath, were enjoying each his respective status."
342,
343,
344,
345,4
346,
347,"Vaishampayana said, ""King Yudhishthira, thus praised by the gods, the"
348,"Maruts and the Rishis, proceeded to that place where those foremost ones"
349,of Kurus race were. He beheld Govinda endued with his Brahma-form. It
350,"resembled that form of his which had been seen before and which,"
351,"therefore, helped the recognition. Blazing forth in that form of his, he"
352,"was adorned with celestial weapons, such as the terrible discus and"
353,others in their respective embodied forms. He was being adored by the
354,"heroic Phalguna, who also was endued with a blazing effulgence. The son"
355,of Kunti beheld the slayer of Madhu also in his own form. Those two
356,"foremost of Beings, adored by all the gods, beholding Yudhishthira,"
357,received him with proper honours.
358,
359,"""In another place, the delighter of the Kurus beheld Karna, that foremost"
360,"one among all wielders of weapons, resembling a dozen Suryas in"
361,"splendour. In another part he beheld Bhimasena of great puissance,"
362,"sitting in the midst of the Maruts, and endued with a blazing form. He"
363,"was sitting by the side of the God of Wind in his embodied form. Indeed,"
364,"he was then in a celestial form endued with great beauty, and had"
365,"attained to the highest success. In place belonging to the Ashvinis, the"
366,"delighter of the Kurus beheld Nakula and Sahadeva, each blazing with his"
367,own effulgence.
368,
369,"""He also beheld the princess of Pancala, decked in garlands of lotuses."
370,"Having attained to Heaven, she was sitting there, endued with a form"
371,possessed of solar splendour. King Yudhishthira suddenly wished to
372,"question her. Then the illustrious Indra, the chief of the gods, spoke to"
373,"him, This one is Sree herself. It was for your sake that she took birth,"
374,"as the daughter of Drupada, among human beings, issuing not from any"
375,"mothers womb, O Yudhishthira, endued with agreeable perfume and capable"
376,"of delighting the whole world. For your pleasure, she was created by the"
377,wielder of the trident. She was born in the race of Drupada and was
378,enjoyed by you all. These five highly blessed Gandharvas endued with the
379,"effulgence of fire, and possessed of great energy, were, O king, the sons"
380,of Draupadi and yourself.
381,
382,"""Behold Dhritarashtra, the king of the Gandharvas, possessed of great"
383,wisdom. Know that this one was the eldest brother of thy sire. This one
384,"is thy eldest brother, the son of Kunti, endued with effulgence of fire."
385,"The son of Surya, thy eldest brother, the foremost of men, even this one"
386,was known as the son of Radha. He moves in the company of Surya. Behold
387,"this foremost of Beings. Among the tribes of the Saddhyas, the gods, the"
388,"Viswedevas, and the Maruts, behold, O king of kings, the mighty"
389,"car-warriors of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, viz., those heroes having"
390,"Satyaki for their first, and those mighty ones among the Bhojas. Behold"
391,"the son of Subhadra, invincible in battle, now staying with Soma. Even he"
392,"is the mighty bowman Abhimanyu, now endued with the gentle effulgence of"
393,"the great luminary of the night. Here is the mighty bowman Pandu, now"
394,united with Kunti and Madri. Thy sire frequently comes to me on his
395,"excellent car. Behold the royal Bhishma, the son of Santanu, now in the"
396,midst of the Vasus. Know that this one by the side of Brihaspati is thy
397,"preceptor Drona. These and other kings, O son of Pandu, who had warred on"
398,thy side now walk with the Gandharvas or Yakshas or other sacred beings.
399,"Some have attained to the status of Guhyakas, O king. Having cast off"
400,"their bodies, they have conquered Heaven by the merit they had acquired"
401,"through word, thought and deed."
402,

412,kings of blazing formstell me for what period they remained in Heaven. O
413,"foremost of regenerate persons, was theirs an eternal place in Heaven?"
414,What was the end attained to by those foremost of men when their acts
415,"came to an end? I desire to hear this, O foremost of regenerate persons,"
416,and therefore have I asked thee. Through thy blazing penances thou seest
417,all things.
418,
419,"Sauti said: Thus questioned, that regenerate Rishi, receiving the"
420,"permission of the high-souled Vyasa, set himself to answer the question"
421,of the king.
422,
423,"Vaishampayana said, ""Every one, O king of men, is not capable of"
424,returning to his own nature at the end of his deeds. Whether this is so
425,"or not, is, indeed a good question asked by thee. Hear, O king, this"
426,"which is a mystery of the gods, O chief of Bharatas race. It was"
427,"explained (to us) by Vyasa of mighty energy, celestial vision and great"
428,"prowess, that ancient ascetic, O Kauravya, who is the son of Parasara and"
429,"who always observes high vows, who is of immeasurable understanding, who"
430,"is omniscient, and who, therefore knows the end attached to all acts."
431,
432,"""Bhishma of mighty energy and great effulgence attained to the status of"
433,"the Vasus. Eight Vasus, O chief of Bharatas race, are now seen. Drona"
434,"entered into Brihaspati, that foremost one of Angirasas descendants."
435,Hridikas son Kritavarma entered the Maruts. Pradyumna entered Sanatkumara
436,"whence he had issued. Dhritarashtra obtained the regions, so difficult of"
437,"acquisition, that belong to the Lord of treasures. The famous Gandhari"
438,obtained the same regions with her husband Dhritarashtra. With his two
439,"wives, Pandu proceeded to the abode of the great Indra. Both Virata and"
440,"Drupada, the king Dhrishtaketu, as also Nishatha, Akrura, Samva,"
441,"Bhanukampa, and Viduratha, and Bhurishrava and Sala and king Bhuri, and"
442,"Kansa, and Ugrasena, and Vasudeva, and Uttara, that foremost of men, with"
443,his brother Sankhaall these foremost of persons entered the deities.
444,"Somas son of great prowess, named Varchas of mighty energy, became"
445,"Abhimanyu, the son of Phalguna, that lion among men. Having fought,"
446,"agreeably to Kshatriya practices, with bravery such as none else had ever"
447,"been able to show, that mighty-armed and righteous-souled being entered"
448,"Soma. Slain on the field of battle, O foremost of men, Karna entered"
449,"Surya. Shakuni obtained absorption into Dwapara, and Dhrishtadyumna into"
450,the deity of fire. The sons of Dhritarashtra were all Rakshasas of fierce
451,"might. Sanctified by death caused by weapons, those high-souled beings of"
452,prosperity all succeeded in attaining to Heaven. Both Kshattri and king
453,Yudhishthira entered into the god of Righteousness. The holy and
454,illustrious Ananta (who had taken birth as Balarama) proceeded to the
455,"region below the Earth. Through the command of the Grandsire, he, aided"
456,"by his Yoga power, supported the Earth. Vasudeva was a portion of that"
457,"eternal god of gods called Narayana. Accordingly, he entered into"
458,"Narayana. 16,000 women had been married to Vasudeva as his wives. When"
459,"the time came, O Janamejaya, they, plunged into the Sarasvati. Casting"
460,"off their (human) bodies there, they re-ascended to Heaven. Transformed"
461,"into Apsaras, they approached the presence of Vasudeva. Those heroic and"
462,"mighty car-warriors, Ghatotkaca and others, who were slain in the great"
463,"battle, attained to the status, some of gods and some of Yakshas. Those"
464,that had fought on the side of Duryodhana are said to have been
465,"Rakshasas. Gradually, O king, they have all attained to excellent regions"
466,"of felicity. Those foremost of men have proceeded, some to the abode of"
467,"Indra, some to that of Kuvera of great intelligence, and some to that of"
468,"Varuna. I have now told thee, O thou of great splendour, everything about"
469,"the acts, O Bharata, of both the Kurus and the Pandavas."
470,
471,"Sauti said: Hearing this, ye foremost of regenerate ones, at the"
472,"intervals of sacrificial rites, king Janamejaya became filled with"
473,wonder. The sacrificial priests then finished the rites that remained to
474,"be gone through. Astika, having rescued the snakes (from fiery death),"
475,became filled with joy. King Janamejaya then gratified all the Brahmanas
476,"with copious presents. Thus worshipped by the king, they returned to"
477,"their respective abodes. Having dismissed those learned Brahmanas, king"
478,Janamejaya came back from Takshasila to the city named after the elephant.
479,
480,"I have now told everything that Vaishampayana narrated, at the command of"
481,"Vyasa, unto the king at his snake sacrifice. Called a history, it is"
482,"sacred, sanctifying and excellent. It has been composed by the ascetic"
483,"Krishna, O Brahmana, of truthful speech. He is omniscient, conversant"
484,"with all ordinances, possessed of a knowledge of all duties, endued with"
485,"piety, capable of perceiving what is beyond the ken of the senses, pure,"
486,"having a soul cleansed by penances, possessed of the six high attributes,"
487,"and devoted to Sankhya Yoga. He has composed this, beholding everything"
488,with a celestial eye that has been cleansed (strengthened) by varied
489,"lore. He has done this, desiring to spread the fame, throughout the"
490,"world, of the high-souled Pandavas, as also of other Kshatriyas possessed"
491,of abundant wealth of energy.
492,
493,That learned man who recites this history of sacred days in the midst of
494,"a listening auditory becomes cleansed of every sin, conquers Heaven, and"
495,attains to the status of Brahma. Of that man who listens with rapt
496,attention to the recitation of the whole of this Veda composed by (the
497,"Island-born) Krishna, a million sins, numbering such grave ones as"
498,"Brahmanicide and the rest, are washed off. The Pitris of that man who"
499,"recites even a small portion of this history at a Sraddha, obtain"
500,inexhaustible food and drink. The sins that one commits during the day by
501,ones senses or the mind are all washed off before evening by reciting a
502,portion of the Mahabharata. Whatever sins a Brahmana may commit at night
503,in the midst of women are all washed off before dawn by reciting a
504,portion of the Mahabharata.
505,
506,The high race of the Bharatas is its topic. Hence it is called Bharata.
507,"And because of its grave import, as also of the Bharatas being its topic,"
508,it is called Mahabharata. He who is versed in interpretations of this
509,"great treatise, becomes cleansed of every sin. Such a man lives in"
510,"righteousness, wealth, and pleasure, and attains to Emancipation also, O"
511,chief of Bharatas race.
512,
513,That which occurs here occurs elsewhere. That which does not occur here
514,occurs nowhere else. This history is known by the name of Jaya. It should
515,be heard by every one desirous of Emancipation. It should be read by
516,"Brahmanas, by kings, and by women quick with children. He that desires"
517,Heaven attains to Heaven; and he that desires victory attains to victory.
518,The woman quick with child gets either a son or a daughter highly
519,"blessed. The puissant Island-born Krishna, who will not have to come"
520,"back, and who is Emancipation incarnate, made an abstract of the Bharata,"
521,moved by the desire of aiding the cause of righteousness. He made another
522,compilation consisting of sixty lakhs of verses. Thirty lakhs of these
523,were placed in the region of the deities. In the region of the Pitris
524,"fifteen lakhs, it should be known, are current; while in that of the"
525,Yakshas fourteen lakhs are in vogue. One lakh is current among human
526,beings.
527,
528,Narada recited the Mahabharata to the gods; Asita-Devala to the Pitris;
529,Suka to the Rakshasas and the Yakshas; and Vaishampayana to human beings.
530,"This history is sacred, and of high import, and regarded as equal to the"
531,"Vedas. That man, O Saunaka, who hears this history, placing a Brahmana"
532,"before him, acquires both fame and the fruition of all his wishes. He"
533,"who, with fervid devotion, listens to a recitation of the Mahabharata,"
534,attains (hereafter) to high success in consequence of the merit that
535,becomes his through understanding even a very small portion thereof. All
536,the sins of that man who recites or listens to this history with devotion
537,are washed off.
538,
539,"In former times, the great Rishi Vyasa, having composed this treatise,"
540,"caused his son Suka to read it with him, along with these four Verses."
541,"Thousands of mothers and fathers, and hundreds of sons and wives arise in"
542,the world and depart from it. Others will (arise and) similarly depart.
543,There are thousands of occasions for joy and hundreds of occasions for
544,fear. These affect only him that is ignorant but never him that is wise.
545,With uplifted arms I am crying aloud but nobody hears me. From
546,"Righteousness is Wealth as also Pleasure. Why should not Righteousness,"
547,"therefore, be courted? For the sake neither of pleasure, nor of fear, nor"
548,"of cupidity should any one cast off Righteousness. Indeed, for the sake"
549,of even life one should not cast off Righteousness. Righteousness is
550,"eternal. Pleasure and Pain are not eternal. Jiva is eternal. The cause,"
551,"however, of Jivas being invested with a body is not so."
552,
553,"That man who, waking up at dawn, reads this Savittri of the Bharata,"
554,acquires all the rewards attached to a recitation of this history and
555,"ultimately attains to the highest Brahma. As the sacred Ocean, as the"
556,"Himavat mountain, are both regarded as mines of precious gems, even so is"
557,"this Bharata (regarded as a mine of precious gems). The man of learning,"
558,by reciting to others this Veda or Agama composed by (the Island-born)
559,"Krishna, earns wealth. There is no doubt in this that he who, with rapt"
560,"attention, recites this history called Bharata, attains to high success."
561,What need has that man of a sprinkling of the waters of Pushkara who
562,"attentively listens to this Bharata, while it is recited to him? It"
563,represents the nectar that fell from the lips of the Island-born. It is
564,"immeasurable, sacred, sanctifying, sin-cleansing, and auspicious."
565,
566,
567,
568,6
569,
570,"Janamejaya said, ""O holy one, according to what rites should the learned"
571,listen to the Bharata? What are the fruits (acquirable by hearing it)?
572,What deities are to be worshipped during the several paranas? What should
573,"be the gifts that one should make, O holy one, at every parva or sacred"
574,day (during the continuance of the recitation)? What should be the
575,qualification of the reciter to be engaged? Tell me all this!
576,
577,"Vaishampayana said, ""Hear, O king, what the procedure is, and what the"
578,"fruits, O Bharata, are that will spring from ones listening (to a"
579,"recitation of the Bharata). Even this, O king of kings, is what thou"
580,"askest me. The deities of Heaven, O ruler of Earth, came to this world"
581,"for sport. Having achieved their task, they ascended once more to Heaven."
582,Listen to what I shall tell thee in brief. In the Mahabharata is to be
583,"found the births of Rishis and deities on the Earth. In this treatise,"
584,"called Bharata, O foremost one of Bharatas race, are to be seen in one"
585,"place the eternal Rudras, the Saddhyas, and the Viswedevas; the Adityas,"
586,"the two deities named the Ashvinis, the regents of the World, the great"
587,"Rishis, the Guhyakas, the Gandharvas, the Nagas, the Vidyadharas, the"
588,"Siddhas, the diverse deities, the Self-born visible in a body, with many"
589,"ascetics; the Hills and Mountains, Oceans and Seas and Rivers, the"
590,"diverse tribes of Apsaras; the Planets, the Years, the Half-years, and"
591,"the Seasons; and the whole universe of mobile and immobile entities, with"
592,all the gods and Asuras.
593,
594,"""Hearing their celebrity, and in consequence of a recitation of their"
595,"names and achievements, a man that has committed even terrible sins, will"
596,"be cleansed. Having, with a concentrated soul and cleansed body, heard"
597,"this history duly, from the beginning, and having reached its end, one"
598,"should make Sraddha offerings, O Bharata, unto those (foremost of persons"
599,"who have been mentioned in it). Unto the Brahmanas also, O chief of"
600,"Bharatas race, should, with due devotion and according to ones power, be"
601,"made large gifts and diverse kinds of gems, and kine, and vessels of"
602,"white brass for milking kine, and maidens decked with every ornament, and"
603,"possessed of every accomplishment suited to enjoyment, as also diverse"
604,"kinds of conveyances, beautiful mansions, plots of land, and cloths."
605,"Animals also should be given, such as horses and elephants in rage, and"
606,"beds, and covered conveyances borne on the shoulders of men, and"
607,"well-decked cars. Whatever objects occur in the house, of the foremost"
608,"kind, whatever wealth of great value occurs in it, should be given away"
609,"unto Brahmanas. Indeed, one should give away ones own self, wives, and"
610,children.
611,
612,"""One desirous of hearing the Bharata, should hear it without a doubting"
613,"heart, with cheerfulness and joy; and as, he proceeds listening to its"
614,"recitation, he should according to the extent of his power, make gifts"
615,with great devotion.
616,
617,"""Hear how a person that is devoted to truth and sincerity, that is"
618,"self-restrained, pure (in mind), and observant of those acts which lead"
619,"to purity of body, that is endued with faith, and that has subjugated"
620,"wrath, attains to success (in the matter of a recitation of the Bharata)."
621,"He should appoint as reciter one that is pure (of body), that is endued"
622,"with good and pious conduct, that should be robed in white, that should"
623,"have a complete mastery over his passions, that is cleansed of all"
624,"offences, that is conversant with every branch of learning, that is"
625,"endued with faith, that is free from malice, that is possessed of"
626,"handsome features, that is blessed, self-restrained, truthful, and with"
627,"passions under control, and that is beloved of all for the gifts he makes"
628,and the honours of which he is the possessor.
629,
630,"""The reciter, seated at his ease, free from all bodily complaints, and"
631,"with rapt attention, should recite the text without too much slowness,"
632,"without a labouring voice, without being fast or quick, quietly, with"
633,"sufficient energy, without confusing the letters and words together, in a"
634,sweet intonation and with such accent and emphasis as would indicate the
635,sense giving full utterance to the three and sixty letters of the
636,"alphabet from the eight places of their formation. Bowing unto Narayana,"
637,"and to Nara, that foremost of men, as also to the goddess Sarasvati,"
638,should the word Jaya be uttered.
639,
640,"""Listening to the Bharata, O king, when recited, O thou of Bharatas race,"
641,"by a reader of this kind, the listener, observant of vows all the while"
642,"and cleansed by purificatory rites, acquires valuable fruits. When the"
643,"first Parana is reached, the hearer should gratify Brahmanas with"
644,"presents of all desirable objects. By doing this, one obtains the fruits"
645,of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. He acquires a large (celestial) car teeming
646,"with diverse orders of Apsaras (that wait upon him). With a glad heart,"
647,"and with the deities in his company, he proceeds to Heaven, his heart"
648,rapt (in felicity).
649,
650,"""When the second Parana is reached, the hearer acquires the fruits of the"
651,"Atiratra vow. Indeed, he ascends a celestial car made entirely of"
652,"precious gems. Wearing celestial garlands and robes, and decked with"
653,"celestial unguents and always shedding a celestial fragrance around, he"
654,receives high honours in Heaven.
655,
656,"""When the third Parana is reached, he acquires the fruits of the"
657,"Dwadasaha vow. Indeed be resides in Heaven for myriads of years, like a"
658,god.
659,
660,"""At the fourth Parana he acquires the fruits of the Vajapeya sacrifice."
661,
662,"""At the fifth, twice those fruits are his. Ascending a celestial car that"
663,"resembles the rising sun or a blazing fire, and with the deities for his"
664,"companions, he goes to Heaven and sports in felicity for myriads of years"
665,in the abode of Indra.
666,
667,"""At the sixth Parana, twice, and at the seventh, thrice those fruits"
668,become his. Ascending a celestial car that resembles the summit of the
669,"Kailasa mountains (in beauty), that is equipt with an altar made of"
670,"stones of lapis lazuli and other precious gems, that is surrounded by"
671,"beautiful objects of diverse kinds, that is decked with gems and corals,"
672,"that moves at the will of the rider, and that teems with waiting Apsaras,"
673,"he roves through all the regions of felicity, like a second deity of the"
674,Sun.
675,
676,"""At the eight Parana, he acquires the fruits of the Rajasuya sacrifice."
677,"He ascends a car as beautiful as the rising moon, and unto which are"
678,yoked steeds white as the rays of the moon and endued with the speed of
679,thought. He is served by women of the foremost beauty and whose faces are
680,more charming than the moon. He hears the music of the garlands that
681,encircle their waists and the Nupuras encircling their ankles. Sleeping
682,"with his head resting on the laps of women of transcendent beauty, he"
683,awakes greatly refreshed.
684,
685,"""At the ninth Parana, he acquires, O Bharata, the fruits of that foremost"
686,"of sacrifices, viz., the Horse-sacrifice. Ascending on a car equipt with"
687,"a chamber consisting of a top supported by columns of gold, furnished"
688,"with a seat made of stones of lapis lazuli, with windows on all sides"
689,"made of pure gold, and teeming with waiting Apsaras and Gandharvas and"
690,"other celestials, he blazes forth in splendour. Wearing celestial"
691,"garlands and robes, and decked with celestial unguents, he sports in"
692,"bliss, with deities for his companions, in Heaven, like a second deity"
693,himself.
694,
695,"""Reaching the tenth Parana and gratifying Brahmanas, he acquires a car"
696,"which tinkles with innumerable bells, which is decked with flags and"
697,"banners, which is equipt with a seat made of precious gems, which has"
698,"many arches made of lapis lazuli, which has a net-work of gold all round,"
699,"which has turrets made of corals, which is adorned with Gandharvas and"
700,"Apsaras well-skilled in singing, and which is fit for the residence of"

707,"""Thus accoutred, he receives high honours in Heaven for many long years."
708,"With Gandharvas in his company, for full 21,000 years, he sports in bliss"
709,with Indra himself in abode of Indra. He roves at pleasure every day
710,"through the diverse regions of the gods, riding on celestial cars and"
711,"conveyances, and surrounded by celestial damsels of transcendent beauty."
712,"He is able to go to the abode of the solar deity, of the lunar deity, and"
713,"of Siva, O king. Indeed, he succeeds in living in the same region with"
714,"Vishnu himself. It is even so, O monarch. There is no doubt in this. A"
715,"person listening with faith, becomes even so. My preceptor has said this."
716,Unto the reciter should be given all such objects as he may wish.
717,"Elephants and steeds and cars and conveyances, especially animals and the"
718,"vehicles they draw, a bracelet of gold, a pair of ear-rings, sacred"

806,"garlands, offering each at a time. Indeed, O king, the several volumes of"
807,this treatise should be worshipped by one with devotion and concentrated
808,mind. Offerings should be made unto them of diverse kinds of food and
809,garlands and drinks and diverse auspicious articles of enjoyment. Gold
810,and other precious metals should be given as Dakshina. The names should
811,"then be taken of all the deities as also of Nara and Narayana. Then,"
812,adorning the persons of some foremost of Brahmanas with scents and
813,"garlands, they should be gratified with diverse kinds of gifts of"
814,"enjoyable and very superior or costly articles. By doing this, one"
815,"attains to the merits of the Atiratra sacrifice. Indeed, at each"
816,"successive Parva, he acquires the merits that attach to the performance"
817,"of a sacrifice. The reciter, O chief of the Bharatas, should be possessed"
818,of learning and endued with a good voice and a clear utterance respecting
819,"both letters and words. Even such a man should, O chief of the Bharatas,"
820,"recite the Bharata. After entertaining a number of foremost Brahmanas,"
821,presents should be made unto them according to the ordinances. The
822,"reciter also, O chief of the Bharatas, should be decked with ornaments"
823,"and fed sumptuously. The reciter being gratified, the house-holder"
824,attains to an excellent and auspicious contentment. If the Brahmanas are
825,"gratified, all the deities are gratified. After this, O chief of the"
826,"Bharatas, Brahmanas should be duly entertained with diverse kinds of"
827,enjoyable articles and superior things.
828,
829,"""I have thus indicated the ordinances, O foremost of men, (about the"
830,manner of reciting these scriptures) in answer to thy enquiries. Thou
831,shouldst observe them with faith. In listening to a recitation of the
832,"Bharata and at each Parana, O best of kings, one that desires to attain"
833,to the highest good should listen with the greatest care and attention.
834,One should listen to the Bharata every day. One should proclaim the
835,"merits of the Bharata every day. One in whose house the Bharata occurs,"
836,has in his hands all those scriptures which are known by the name of
837,Jaya. The Bharata is cleansing and sacred. In the Bharata are diverse
838,topics. The Bharata is worshipped by the very gods. The Bharata is the
839,"highest goal. The Bharata, O chief of the Bharatas, is the foremost of"
840,all scriptures. One attains to Emancipation through the Bharata. This
841,that I tell thee is certain truth. One that proclaims the merits of this
842,"history called the Mahabharata, of the Earth, of the cow, of Sarasvati"
843,"(the goddess of speech), of Brahmanas, and of Keshava, has never to"
844,languish.
845,
846,"""In the Vedas, in the Ramayana, and in the sacred Bharata, O chief of"
847,"Bharatas race, Hari is sung in the beginning, the middle, and at the end."
848,"That in which occur excellent statements relating to Vishnu, and the"
849,"eternal Srutis, should be listened to by men desirous of attaining to the"
850,highest goal. This treatise is sanctifying. This is the highest indicator
851,as regards duties; this is endued with every merit. One desirous of
852,"prosperity should listen to it. Sins committed by means of the body, by"
853,"means of words, and by means of the mind, are all destroyed (through"
854,listening to the Bharata) as Darkness at sunrise. One devoted to Vishnu
855,acquires (through this) that merit which is acquired by listening to the
856,eighteen Puranas. There is no doubt in this. Men and women (by listening
857,to this) would certainly attain to the status of Vishnu. Women desirous
858,of having children should certainly listen to this which proclaims the
859,fame of Vishnu. One desirous of attaining to the fruits that attach to a
860,"recitation of the Bharata should, according to ones power, give unto the"
861,"reciter Dakshina, as also an honorarium in gold. One desirous of ones own"
862,good should give unto the reciter a Kapila cow with horns cased in gold
863,"and accompanied by her calf, covered with a cloth. Ornaments, O chief of"
864,"Bharatas race, for the arms, as also those for the ears, should be given."
865,"Besides these, other kinds of wealth should be presented. Unto the"
866,"reciter, O king of men, gift of land should be made. No gift like that of"
867,land could ever be or will be. The man that listens (to the Bharata) or
868,"that recites it to other people, becomes cleansed of all his sins and"
869,attains at last to the status of Vishnu. Such a man rescues his ancestors
870,"to the eleventh degree, as also himself with his wives and sons, O chief"
871,"of Bharatas race. After concluding a recitation of the Bharata, one"
872,"should, O king, perform a Homa with all its ten parts."
873,
874,"""I have thus, O chief of men, told everything in thy presence. He that"
875,listens with devotion to this Bharata from the beginning becomes cleansed
876,of every sin even if he be guilty of Brahmanicide or the violation of his
877,"preceptors bed, or even if he be a drinker of alcohol or a robber of"
878,"other peoples wares, or even if he be born in the Chandala order."
879,"Destroying all his sins like the maker of day destroying darkness, such a"
880,"man, without doubt, sports in felicity in the region of Vishnu like"
881,"Vishnu himself."""
